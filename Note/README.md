### Abstract
Simple O(ND) time and space algorithm is developed where
N : A + B
D : size of minimum edit script for A and B
E(T) = O(N+D^2) basic stochastic model
* [Stochastic Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_modelling_(insurance))

Refindment of algorithem requires only O(N) space and use of suffix trees leading to O(N * lg(N) + D^2)
* [Suffix Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suffix_tree)
